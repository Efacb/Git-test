              It is key to use parboiled rice so that you donâ€™t end up with mushy rice in the end.
             </li>
             
             <li>
            When cooking the tomato stew, you can tell when it is done because the oil will rise to the top. It will be a deep red color and the bitter taste of the tomatoes has been cooked out.
            </li>
          <li>
            Reserve 1/4th of the tomato mixture and add it at the end to help prevent the rice from burning. Also, it gives the rice that beautiful red color we all know and love.</li>
            
          <li>
            Cover the top of the pot with plastic wrap before putting the lid on to help keep all the steam in the pot.
            </li>
                    </ol>
